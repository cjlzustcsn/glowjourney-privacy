**Privacy Policy – GlowJourney**

Effective: December 2024  
Developer: 89 (DaySpark Project)

GlowJourney is a personal anniversary and mood tracker. We respect your privacy and keep all data on your device. This policy explains what information the app does—and does not—collect.

1. **Data Collection & Storage**  
   GlowJourney does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data on external servers. All anniversaries, notes, and settings stay locally on your device.

2. **Analytics & Tracking**  
   The app does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies.

3. **Network Communication**  
   GlowJourney does not communicate with external servers except for services provided by Apple (App Store updates, crash reports handled by the operating system).

4. **Children’s Privacy**  
   GlowJourney is suitable for general audiences. We do not collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided data, please contact us for assistance.

5. **Security**  
   Because all information resides on your device, we rely on iOS security features (such as device passcode and Face/Touch ID) to protect your data.

6. **Changes to This Policy**  
   We may update this policy for future versions of GlowJourney. Updates will be posted at the same URL.

7. **Contact**
